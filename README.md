# Lux
Lux is a cross-platform game framework made in C# and with the [FNA framework](https://github.com/FNA-XNA/FNA).

**This is a personal project, you shouldn't actually use it.** Yet you're welcome to if you find it useful for making your own game. If you do choose to use it, count yourself lucky as this project is filled with comments to help you navigate it.

## Quickstart

Don't worry, the [wiki](https://github.com/lagzidev/Lux/wiki) got you covered.

## Useful Material
* [Game programming patterns book](http://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/contents.html) - Really great book for game engine design.

* [FNA Tutorial series](https://gist.github.com/flibitijibibo/1ce4b7899b3cf1805a420330f0d2faf3#the-first-download) - A great comprehensive learning resource for new FNA users.

* [Useful MonoGame related links](http://community.monogame.net/t/useful-monogame-related-links-u-mg-rl/8573/22) - Less relevent for FNA but still worth keeping saving.

* [Introduction to MonoGame](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/xamarin/graphics-games/monogame/introduction/) - by Microsoft.

* [awesome-monogame](https://github.com/aloisdeniel/awesome-monogame) - A hand-picked bookmark collection of libraries for building games with Monogame (many work with FNA as well).
